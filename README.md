## Extras

### Fstab

These are some good options when using a shared partition between Windows &
Linux for a Steam installation

- The uid/gid need to be set to avoid everything being root-owned

```
UUID=XXXXXX /mnt/X/ ntfs defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000,errors=remount-ro 0 0 
```

## Aesthetic CLI tools

### Streaming tools

These are made to be used in a massive font size/zoom level, I use them when streaming to try and give some info about me and the stream that's pretty/eye-catching and easy to read
